## 3. Roles in a Database System

In a typical database project, several roles work together to design, build, and manage the system. Below are the key roles and their responsibilities:

- 🔹 System Analyst  
  Gathers requirements from stakeholders, analyzes business processes, and defines what the database system should accomplish.

- 🔹 Database Designer  
  Designs the structure of the database including tables, relationships, keys, and constraints to meet the system requirements.

- 🔹 Database Developer  
  Writes the SQL code to create tables, views, stored procedures, triggers, and other database components.

- 🔹 Database Administrator (DBA)  
  Manages and maintains the database environment. This includes tasks like backup and recovery, user access control, performance tuning, and security.

- 🔹 Application Developer  
  Develops the front-end or back-end application that interacts with the database. They ensure the app sends and retrieves data correctly.

- 🔹 Business Intelligence (BI) Developer  
  Creates dashboards, reports, and data visualizations. They transform raw data into meaningful insights for decision-making.

  ## 4. Types of Databases

There are several types of databases, each designed for specific needs and use cases. Below is a summary of the most common types:

### 🔹 Relational vs. Non-Relational Databases

- 🗂️ Relational Databases (RDBMS):  
  - Store data in structured tables with rows and columns.  
  - Use SQL (Structured Query Language) for querying.  
  - Support relationships between tables (e.g., foreign keys).  
  - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.

- 📦 Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL):  
  - Store data in flexible formats (documents, key-value pairs, graphs, etc.).  
  - Do not require a fixed schema.  
  - Often used for big data, real-time applications, or unstructured data.  
  - Examples: MongoDB (document), Cassandra (wide-column), Redis (key-value), Neo4j (graph).

### 🔹 Centralized vs. Distributed vs. Cloud Databases

- 🖥️ Centralized Database:  
  - All data is stored and accessed from a single central location/server.  
  - Easy to manage but limited scalability.  
  - Example Use Case: Small office systems.

- 🌐 Distributed Database:  
  - Data is spread across multiple locations/servers, often geographically distributed.  
  - Offers higher availability and performance.  
  - Example Use Case: Global e-commerce platforms.

- ☁️ Cloud Database:  
  - Hosted and managed in the cloud by providers like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud.  
  - Scalable, accessible from anywhere, and managed as a service.  
  - Examples: Amazon RDS, Azure SQL Database, Google Cloud Spanner.  
  - Use Case: Web and mobile apps with variable traffic.

### 🔹 Use Case Examples

| Database Type             | Example Systems or Applications                 |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Relational (e.g., MySQL)  | Banking systems, school management, ERP systems |
| Non-Relational (e.g., MongoDB) | Social media platforms, product catalogs        |
| Distributed               | Online shopping platforms like Amazon           |
| Cloud                     | SaaS apps, mobile backends, analytics systems   |


## 5. Cloud Storage and Databases

Cloud storage and cloud-based databases are essential parts of modern data systems. This section explains their relationship, benefits, and challenges.

### 🔹 What is Cloud Storage?

Cloud storage is a service that allows data to be stored remotely on internet-based servers (in the cloud), rather than on local physical drives. It enables users to access, manage, and share data anytime, from anywhere.

Examples of cloud storage providers:
- Google Drive
- Dropbox
- Amazon S3

### 🔹 How Does Cloud Storage Support Databases?

Cloud infrastructure provides the foundation for hosting and managing databases online. Cloud-based databases are built on top of cloud storage, allowing them to:

- Scale easily as data grows
- Be accessed remotely from different locations
- Be managed and maintained by service providers

Many cloud providers offer “Database-as-a-Service” (DBaaS), which removes the need to manage hardware or installations manually.

### 🔹 Advantages of Cloud-Based Databases

- ☁️ Scalability: Easily handle growing amounts of data or users.
- 🔐 Security: Built-in encryption, access control, and backups.
- 💰 Cost Efficiency: Pay-as-you-go pric
