| Structure        | Stores data in plain text files (e.g., CSV, Excel)  | Stores data in structured tables with defined schemas    |
| Data Redundancy  | High â€” data is often repeated                        | Low â€” uses relationships to avoid data duplication       |
| Relationships    | No relationships between data records                | Supports relationships (e.g., one-to-many, many-to-many) |
| Example Usage    | Employee list in a spreadsheet                       | Company HR system with multiple connected tables         |
| Drawbacks        | Difficult to update, search, and maintain            | Requires setup, design, and knowledge of SQL             |
